== Description ==

Easily integrate the popular WooCommerce plugin with Pagelines. 

<strong> Note:</strong> To use this plugin you need to have the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce/" target="_blank" title="WooCommerce">WooCommerce</a> plugin installed.

This plugin adds several sections to Pagelines specifically for WooCommerce:
* Breadcrumbs
* Product content
* Product loop
* Product pagination
* Related products
* Upsells

Add Pagelines Sections to your Product Archive and Product Pages.

Buttons and Tabs have Pagelines styles while using color controls from WooCommerce Settings. 

This plugin is free for all to use and to encourage developers to develop WooCommerce sections and themes.

<strong>Support is only for the WooCommerce for Pagelines plugin.</strong> WooCommerce for Pagelines makes the Pagelines framework and WooCommerce plugin work well together. Support for WooCommerce can be found on their website <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/" target="_blank" title="WooCommerce">http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/</a>.

<strong>If products still displaying in single column after activating the plugin do this:</strong>

1) Go to WooCommerce -> Settings -> General Settings and scroll down and Save Options

2) Go to Pagelines -> Site Options and click on Save Options

Now view page and should be in order. If still have a problem post in the Pagelines Forum or contact me using the contact button.
