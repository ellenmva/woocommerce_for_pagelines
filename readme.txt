Refines and configures the popular WooCommerce plugin for seamless integration into PageLines. 

== Description ==

Easily integrate the popular WooCommerce plugin with pagelines.

This plugin adds several sections to Pagelines specifically for WooCommerce:
* Breadcrumbs
* Product content
* Product loop
* Product pagination
* Related products
* Upsells

Use at your own risk, adapt, fork, modify, whatever :) I'm not a pagelines user, this was created for a user. Hope you find this plugin useful.
